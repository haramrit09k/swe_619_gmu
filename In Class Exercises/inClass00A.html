<em>Instructions</em>:  Work with your neighbors in groups.
This exercise touches on
some of the thorny issues in data abstraction and inheritance.
There is a lot going on in this example.
Hence
don't worry if it seems confusing today.
We'll revisit this example several times over the course of the semester.

<p>
Consider the following (textbook) code:
<pre>
public class User {
    private String name;
    public User (String name) { this.name = name; }
    @Override public boolean equals (Object obj) {
       if (!(obj instanceof User)) return false;
       return ((User) obj).name.equals(this.name);
    }
}
public class SpecialUser extends User {
    private int id;
    public SpecialUser (String name, int id) { super(name); this.id = id; }
    @Override public boolean equals (Object obj) {
       if (!(obj instanceof SpecialUser)) return false;
       return super.equals(obj) && ((SpecialUser) obj).id == this.id;
    }
}
</pre>
<OL>
<LI> What does it mean for the <code>equals()</code> method
to be <b>correct</b>?  How do you know?
Be as concrete as you can.  Can you check correctness
with test cases?
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<LI> How does the given implementation of <code>equals()</code> in
in class <code>User</code> stack up?
Again, be concrete.
Can you find a test case that demonstrates the problem?
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<LI> How does inheritance complicate the correctness
discussion for <code>equals()</code> 
in class <code>SpecialUser</code>?
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<LI> What do you think of the <code>equals()</code>
method in the <code>SpecialUser</code> class?
</OL>
