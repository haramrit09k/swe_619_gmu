  SWE 619 In Class Exercise Number 0B <BR>

<HR>
<P>
This may look like (just) a testing exercise, 
but I want us to view it as a specification exercise.
<pre>
  /**
    * Returns the mininum element in a list
    * @param list Comparable list of elements to search
    * @return the minimum element in the list
    * @throws NullPointerException if list is null or
    *         if any list elements are null
    * @throws ClassCastException if list elements are not mutually comparable
    * @throws IllegalArgumentException if list is empty
    */
    public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt; T min (List&lt;? extends T&gt; list) {
       if (list.size() == 0) {
          throw new IllegalArgumentException ("Min.min");
       }

       T result = list.get(0);

       for (T comp : list) {
           if (comp.compareTo(result) < 0) {    // throws NPE, CCE as needed
               result = comp;
           }
       }
       return result;
    }

Identify tests you think are necessary for this code.
Justify each test.
<UL>
<LI>	First, think about happy path tests.
<LI>	Next, think about remaining tests.
<LI>	Which of these tests come from the specification, and which come from the code?
</UL>
<p>
How do we transform these tests into JUnit?
