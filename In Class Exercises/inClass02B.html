Consider Liskov's Poly example, where an abstract Poly
is defined as c0 + c1x + c2x^2 + ...,
and is implemented with two variables:
<pre>
   private int deg;
   private int[] trms;
</pre>
Fill in example values that are mapped by the abstraction function.
<pre>
Abstract Poly State:

Representation State: (deg, trms)
</pre>
<OL>
<LI>
Identify representation states that should not be mapped.
<LI>
Try to capture these states with a rule (that is, a rep-invariant).
<LI>
Devise a representation that is suitable for a mutable version of Poly.
<LI>
Develop a rep-invariant for that representation.
