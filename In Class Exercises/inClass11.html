This is a JUnit theory exercise.

<OL>
<LI>
Recall the <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> discussion in Bloch.
Write a JUnit theory that encodes the consistency
property between  <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code>.
<br> <br> <br>
<LI>
Provide some "data points" for  the theory.
Given this set of data points: 
<UL>
<LI> How many combinations are considered by the theory?
<LI> How many combinations make it past the preconditions of the theory?
<LI> How many combinations make it to the postcondition of the theory?
</UL>

<br> <br> <br>

<LI>
Build a toy example that violates the theory.
Fix the toy example so that the theory is no longer violated.
<br> <br> <br>
<LI>
Repeat the exercise for the symmetric and transitive properties for <code>equals()</code>.
<br> <br> <br>
<LI>
What happens to these theories/data points when favoring composition over inheritance?
<br> <br> <br>
<LI>
Consider the <code>Comparable</code> interface:
what properties should be checked with theories?
